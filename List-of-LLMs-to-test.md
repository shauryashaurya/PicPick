Possible LLMs to test:  
  
* Mistral 7B: relatively small size.     
* Alpaca 7B: efficiency and performance on a range of natural language processing tasks.  
* Vicuna 7B/13B: fine-tuned from LLaMA on user-shared conversations, capabilities in conversational settings, may be interesting for interacting with users in a recommendation system.     
* Koala: fine-tuned from LLaMA on publicly available datasets, could be useful for handling both user interactions and the structured data in the MovieLens dataset.     
* Dolly-V2: open-source from DataBricks, yet another option for a recommendation system
