# PicPick - Your Personal AI Movie Recommendation System: A Hands-on Workshop with RAG and Local LLMs

# Abstract
In this 90-minute hands-on tutorial, we'll build ***PicPick*** *a personalized movie recommender* that runs entirely on your machine, *for free*.     
  
We'll harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing an intuitive interface to interact with complex movie data.   
You'll learn how to tackle the challenge of handling structured movie data from the MovieLens dataset, leverage local LLMs, and fine-tune prompts to generate tailored movie suggestions.  
  
Walk away not only with a working movie recommender but also the technical know-how to apply these techniques to a wide range of GenAI applications - Build intelligent chatbots, create powerful product recommenders, and more - done mostly without expensive cloud infrastructure.   
  
  
  
# Description  
  
We’ll explore how to set up a RAG framework that integrates a knowledge base and retrieval mechanism to enhance LLM-generated recommendations.  
We’ll walk through the process of generating movie recommendations based on user input.    
By the end of the workshop, we’ll have a functioning movie recommendation system that utilizes both retrieval and language generation techniques.   

The workshop will cover:
* The Basics of Recommendation systems, taking example of generating Movie Recommendations
* Quick overview of traditional recommendation systems (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering).
* Introduction to LLM-based movie recommendations.
* Examples of recommendation use cases using IMDB or MovieLens.
* Implementing RAG for Enhanced Recommendations
* Introduction to the RAG framework and its benefits for recommendation systems.
* Step-by-step guide to setting up a retrieval system (using FAISS or Elasticsearch).
* Building a knowledge base from movie datasets.
* Integrating the retrieval mechanism with an LLM to enhance recommendation quality.
  
Takeaways:   
* Practical experience building a recommendation system using LLMs and retrieval mechanisms.   
* Deep understanding of how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves personalization.    
* Skills to integrate RAG techniques into your own recommendation projects or other NLP applications.

About:  
I (Shaurya) have had the opportunity to speak at international forums like PyData Global 2023, PyCon India 2023, PyCascades 2024 and more. With this tutorial my hope is to excite a discussion around LLMs and how we can better leverage structured data.

# Notes  

Target Audience: suitable for data scientists - novice or practicing, AI/ML engineers, and GenAI/NLP practitioners at all levels who may be interested in building modern recommendation systems. Basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with LLMs or NLP concepts is recommended, but not required.
